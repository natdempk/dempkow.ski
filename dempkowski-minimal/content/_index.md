Hi, I'm Nat Dempkowski a software engineer living in Boston.

I'm currently working at [Suno](https://suno.com) on all things engineering, especially focused on backend and infrastructure. I enjoy solving problems that blend product challenges with engineering at scale.

I'm generally excited about technology, distributed systems, data processing, building products, AI, music, music technology, learning, tools for learning efficiently, and much more!

Previously, I worked at [HubSpot](https://hubspot.com) for years across Email, Conversations, and List Segmentation writing reliable and scalable Java services and infrastucture and leading teams that owned some of the highest-scale product-platform problems. I've worked with a bunch of distributed systems like Hadoop, HBase, Kafka, ElasticSeach, Vitess (MySQL), Memcached, and more.

Before that, I also interned at [InsightSquared](https://www.insightsquared.com) and [Akamai](https://akamai.com).
